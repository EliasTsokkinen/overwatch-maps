# overwatch-maps
A program to store wins, losses and draws you've had on Overwatch maps.

Lets you calculate your win percentages on different maps, maptypes and overall.

Has a feature that allows you to export your data as a .csv so you can edit it with e.g. Excel or Calc.

On first startup creates a file ".data.owmd" which stores all data and preferences. If you move the .exe to a new directory,
make sure you also move this file.
